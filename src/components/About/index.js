        <p>Why must I spend mine with you?</p>
        <p>If the show must go on</p>
        <p>Let it go on without you</p>
        <p>So sick and tired hanging around with jerks like you</p>
        <p>Who'll tell me those lies</p>
        <p>And let me think they're true? Yeah</p>
        <p>What am I to do</p>
        <p>You want it, I got it too</p>
        <p>For the laughs may be cheap</p>
        <p>That's just 'cause the joke's about you</p>
        <p>I'm so sick and tired hanging around with dogs like you</p>
        <p>You're the first to get blamed, always the last bitch to get paid</p>
        <p>Oh, tell me those lies</p>
        <p>Let me think they're true yeah</p>
        <p>I heard one or two</p>
        <p>They weren't about me, they weren't about her</p>
        <p>They were all about you</p>
        <p>I may miss you</p>
        <p>But missing me just isn't you</p>

        <p>Hanging around with dogs</p>
        <p>Who told me those lies</p>
        <p>Let me think they're true</p>
        <p>I heard one or two, and they weren't about me, they weren't about her</p>
        <p>They're all about you</p>
        <p>All about you I'm so sick and tired</p>
        <p>What should I do</p>
        <p>You want it, want it, want it, you get it, you get it, you get it</p>
