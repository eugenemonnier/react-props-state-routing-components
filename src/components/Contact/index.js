        <p>I saw her today at the reception</p>
        <p>A glass of wine in her hand</p>
        <p>I knew she would meet her connection</p>
        <p>At her feet was a footloose man</p>
        <p>No, you can't always get what you want</p>
        <p>You can't always get what you want</p>
        <p>You can't always get what you want</p>
        <p>But if you try sometime</p>
        <p>You'll find</p>
        <p>You get what you need</p>

        <p>You can't always get what you want</p>
        <p>But if you try sometimes</p>
        <p>Well, you might find</p>
        <p>You get what you need</p>
        <br/>
        <p>And I went down to the demonstration</p>
        <p>To get my fair share of abuse</p>
        <p>Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration</p>
        <p>If we don't, we're going to blow a 50-amp fuse"</p>
        <p>Sing it to me</p>

        <p>I went down to the Chelsea drugstore</p>
        <p>To get your prescription filled</p>
        <p>I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy</p>
        <p>And man, did he look pretty ill</p>
        <p>We decided that we would have a soda</p>
        <p>My favorite flavor, cherry red</p>
        <p>I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy</p>
        <p>Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "death"</p>
        <p>I said to him</p>
        <br/>
        <p>You can't always get what you want</p>
        <p>You can't always get what you want</p>

        <p>I saw her today at the reception</p>
        <p>In her glass was a bleeding man</p>
        <p>She was practiced at the art of deception</p>
        <p>Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands</p>
        <p>Sing it to me</p>
        <br/>
        <p>You can't always get what you want, yeah</p>
        <p>You can't always get what you want, ooh yeah</p>
        <p>You can't always get what you want</p>

        <p>Ah yeah</p>
        <p>Wooh!</p>
        <p>Ah you can't always get what you want</p>
